# ConvNeXt

This repository provides a clean and concise PyTorch implementation of the ConvNeXt model, inspired by the official papers and existing open-source implementations.

ConvNeXt is a pure ConvNet model that achieves competitive performance with Transformers, demonstrating that standard ResNets can be updated to surpass Swin Transformers' accuracy and efficiency.

## Features

-   **Modular Design**: Separates the ConvNeXt block and the full model for clarity.
-   **PyTorch Native**: Built entirely using PyTorch for easy integration into existing PyTorch workflows.
-   **Configurable**: Supports easy adjustment of model `depths` and `dims` to create different ConvNeXt variants (Tiny, Small, Base, Large, etc.).
-   **Basic Initialization**: Includes weight initialization based on common practices for ConvNets.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Seif-Yasser-Ahmed/convNeXt.git
    cd convNeXt
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Model Definition

The core `ConvNeXtBlock` and `ConvNeXt` model are defined in `convnext_block.py` and `convnext_model.py` respectively.

You can instantiate the model as follows:

```python
from convnext_model import ConvNeXt
import torch

# Example: ConvNeXt-Tiny like configuration (default in ConvNeXt class)
model = ConvNeXt(in_chans=3, num_classes=1000)

# Example: Custom configuration
# model_small = ConvNeXt(depths=[3, 3, 27, 3], dims=[96, 192, 384, 768], num_classes=100)

print(model)
````

### Running Tests

A simple test script `test.py` is provided to quickly verify that the model can be instantiated and process input tensors, returning the expected output shape.

To run the test:

```bash
python test.py
```

Expected output:

```
torch.Size([1, 10])
```

## Acknowledgements

This implementation is heavily inspired by and benefits from the excellent work in the following repositories:

  * **`pytorch-image-models` (timm)** by Ross Wightman:
    The structure and implementation details, particularly within `convnext_model.py` and `convnext_block.py`, draw heavily from the `timm/models/convnext.py` implementation. `timm` serves as a fantastic reference for robust and optimized PyTorch model implementations.

  * **`ConvNeXt-V2`** by Facebook AI:
    The original research and official code release for ConvNeXt. This project aims to recreate the core architecture and principles outlined in their work.
